Given - The Amazon Aurora DB has a primary instance and five Aurora Replicas.

Observation - The primary instance is getting overutilized with the read requests.

Suggestions:

**Scenario 1**: If the application just needs to read data from the database.
- Suggestion: Point application to reader endpoint of the Amazon Aurora.
- Reason: The read request will be distributed among the 5 read replicas. No read request will reach the primary instance and hence will decrease the load on primary instance.

**Scenario 2**: If the application needs both read and write data to the database.
- Suggestion: Point application read queries to reader endpoint of the Amazon Aurora. And point the application write queries to cluster endpoint of the Amazon Aurora.
- Reason: The write queries will be rejected if the request goes to the read replica.
