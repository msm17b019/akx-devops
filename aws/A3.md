Given - Archived all the data to Amazon S3 Glacier for a long term.

Requirement - Needs to retrieve some portion of the archived data regularly. This retrieval process is quite random and incurs a good amount of cost.

Priority - Cost reduction

Suggestion:

- Max Retrieval Rate is the best option.
- The Free Tier Only is not recommended as the free tier is just for a year after the AWS account sign-up.
- Other options will not help in cost reduction.
