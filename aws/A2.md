Given - Produces highly sensitive data and stores in Amazon S3.

Requirement - Own encryption key but doesn't want to maintain any code to perform data encryption and decryption.

Other requirement - Responsible for storing the Secret key.

Suggestion:

- Use Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).

- This allows the use of own encryption key while no need to maintain any code for encryption and decryption.

- The key will be stored securely in the AWS KMS. So it meets the other requirement.

- Other options don't meet the requirements. Either the team will have no control over the encryption key or will need to maintain the encryption and decryption code.
