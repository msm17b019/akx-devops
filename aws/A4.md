Given - Looking for file storage in AWS that supports Network File System version 4 (NFSv4.1 and NFSv4.0) protocol.

Requirement - A simple, serverless, set-and-forget service that can grow and
shrink automatically as they add and remove files.

Priority - Save cost by transitioning the files that have not been accessed for quite some time automatically to a low-cost storage tier.

Suggestion:

- Use Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) with lifecycle policy is the best solution.

- The S3 is an object storage service. But the customer is looking for file storage in AWS. So options related to S3 is not useful in this case.

- Amazon FSx for Lustre doesn't support NFS protocol.
