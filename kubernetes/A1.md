The correct answer is **Check the logs using kubectl logs and the -c flag, specifying each container**.

Logic:

The kubectl logs command is used to print the logs for a container in a pod. If there is only one container in the pod, then there is no need to specify the container name using the -c flag. But in this case there are two containers in the pod, so we need to pass the specific container name to check the logs of that container. Each container generates its own logs, so specifying the container name is important.

Using the -f flag allows us to view the real-time logs. Basically it streams the log. It is particularly useful when debugging the issues and needs feedback in real time. In the problem, we just want to learn about the issue. So it is not needed.

Open an interactive shell to try restarting services in the containers might be used for troubleshooting depending on the issues. But in this case, we just want to learn about the issue. As a first step, we are learning about the issue and then based on that we can take necessary action. So it is not the correct answer.
