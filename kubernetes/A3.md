Using a single AWS load balancer for all of our microservices or use a load balancer per microservice.

In my opinion, using a **single AWS load balancer for all of our microservices** is a better solution. Reasons are as follows:

- Having multiple load balancers means having multiple node ports exposed. Opening multiple ports means increased surface attack. So in terms of security, it is important to have less ports open.
- With a single load balancer, we can easily manage the configurations.
- It is cost effective to use a single load balancer.
- The AWS load balancer is a managed service. So when the requests are high, the AWS will scale up the backend. If better performance is needed, we can use a network load balancer as well. It can handle millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies.
- The AWS load balancer can run in multiple subnets. So selecting multiple subnets decreases the chance of failure.


**Note** - Using an NGINX Ingress Controller for internal routing and a single load balancer for external traffic distribution offers a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for managing microservices in Kubernetes environments.
